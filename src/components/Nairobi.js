          As a local, I love the Maasai Market and still visit on a regular
          basis when I’m in Nairobi. It’s no surprise that it’s one of the top
          Nairobi attractions. The Maasai Market is an open-air market in
          Nairobi that’s held in different locations throughout the week.
          Travelers visit the Masai Market to see and shop for gifts and
          keepsakes like paintings, beads, jewelry, fabrics, and wood carvings.
          The best days to visit are Saturdays and Sundays when the market is
          located in Nairobi city center, (at the high court parking lot). An
          alternative to the Masai Market is the City Market which is open
          daily. If you’re keen to test your bargaining skills, join this Maasai
          Market shopping experience in Nairobi.{" "}

          Without experiencing the nightlife, a trip to any city or town is
          usually incomplete. In my younger years, I spent a lot of time
          enjoying late nights out in Nairobi and I can say from experience that
          the nightlife is truly excellent. Exploring Nairobi at night is great,
          and it’s a fun and exciting way to experience the local culture. You
          can indulge in nighttime activities like partying, board gaming,
          karaoke, dancing, watching plays, or listening to live bands. Try out
          local food like Nyama Choma and Kachumbari, drink Tusker beer, (an
          East African pale lager), and create some moments to remember by
          joining this amazing Nairobi nightlife experience.

          Museums are places of discovery, contemplation and learning: The
          Institution of National Museums of Kenya is anchored on four pillars
          notably culture, history, arts and nature. The Nairobi National Museum
          is only 20 minutes from the Central Business District. Historical
          Background The Museum was initiated in 1910 by a group of enthusiastic
          naturalists under the then East Africa and Uganda Natural History
          Society [currently the East African Natural History Society (EANHS)],
          who needed a place to keep and preserve their collections of various
          specimens. The first site for the Museum was at the present Nyayo
          House, which later became too small and a larger building was put up
          in 1922 where the Nairobi Serena Hotel stands today. In 1929, the
          colonial government set aside land for a Museum construction at Museum
          Hill which was officially opened in 22nd September, 1930 and named
          Coryndon Museum in honour of Sir Robert Coryndon, one-time Governor of
          Kenya. In 1963 after independence, it was re-named the National Museum
          of Kenya (NMK). On October 15th 2005, the Nairobi Museum closed its
          doors to the public for an extensive modernization and expansion
          project the outcome of which was an impressive and magnificent piece
          of architecture that puts it in competition with other world- class
          Museums.

          The Maasai Ostrich Farm, which is East African’s largest commercial

          meat, skins, and live ostrich throughout Kenya and abroad. Around 1000
          birds of two breeds are maintained: the blue-neck or Somali ostrich
          and the Maasai ostrich, which has a pink neck and legs.Ostrich is one
          of the largest living species of bird in the world. Ostriches are
          known for their amazingly long necks, lofty heights, two toes and
          large eye ball. Male ostriches also known as cocks, are identified by
          their rigorous display dances swinging their passionate pink necks
          sideways. Come and dance to the tune of a Maasai Ostrich at the farm.
          Ostrich feather is used as a court symbol of justice in Egypt due to

          If you love elephants (especially baby ones), you’re going to love the
          Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, (formerly the David Sheldrick Wildlife
          Trust) a rehabilitation centre for abandoned or orphaned baby
          elephants (and other animals, occasionally rhinos) who are too young
          to survive in the wild on their own. The elephant orphanage in Nairobi
          was started by the late Dame Daphne Sheldrick in memory of her late
          husband, David, a legendary ranger of Tsavo National Park. The
          elephants are cared for and then released back into the wild when they
          are old enough. Visitors are allowed in at 11 a.m. each day for
          approximately 1 hour to see the elephants and listen to a talk by one
          of the keepers. Sometimes the baby elephants come up to say hello and
          I’ve had my foot trodden on many times! You can adopt a baby elephant
          for as little as £35 a year which also gives you access to visit
          outside of the usual hours.
