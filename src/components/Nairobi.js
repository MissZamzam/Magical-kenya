        <p>An initiative of the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife, (AFEW), The Giraffe Centre is a conservation, education, and breeding center for the endangered Rothschild’s giraffe.
           It’s open daily between 09:00 am and 5:00 pm, including weekends and public holidays. Aside from the information center, there’s also an elevated platform that allows you to hand-feed the giraffes.The center is one of the most popular day trip destinations in Nairobi. It’s also part of the Nairobi wildlife experiences which include a game drive at Nairobi National Park, a visit to the Elephant Sanctuary, and the Karen Blixen Museum.
           If you only have one day in the city, the Giraffe Center should be one of your top things to do in Nairobi. Another option is to spend a night at this gorgeous Airbnb that’s right next door to both The Giraffe Center and The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust center.</p>
        
        <h1>Nairobi National Park</h1>
        <img id="img1" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9a/03/fa/9a03fa03632fb328e7baf42bc6d043c5.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>Nairobi National Park is situated a few kilometers from the city center. Aside from being one of the best places to visit in Nairobi, the park is a good starting point for game reserve and safari trips in Kenya.
           It’s accessible both by private and public means from the capital. However, the best way to experience this magical park is by taking a guided game drive.
           During the 4-hour early morning game drive of the Nairobi National Park, you’ll have the chance to spot wildlife like lions, black rhinos, cheetahs, buffalos, giraffes, and hippos, as well as many bird species.Some people prefer doing the game drive only, but visiting the Safari Walk inside the park is also both educating and refreshing. The safari walk is home to rhinos, hyenas, and other wild animals. It ranks high up as one of the best places to visit in Nairobi for couples.</p>

        <p>As a local, I love the Maasai Market and still visit on a regular basis when I’m in Nairobi. It’s no surprise that it’s one of the top Nairobi attractions.
           The Maasai Market is an open-air market in Nairobi that’s held in different locations throughout the week.
           Travelers visit the Masai Market to see and shop for gifts and keepsakes like paintings, beads, jewelry, fabrics, and wood carvings.
           The best days to visit are Saturdays and Sundays when the market is located in Nairobi city center, (at the high court parking lot).
           An alternative to the Masai Market is the City Market which is open daily.
           If you’re keen to test your bargaining skills, join this Maasai Market shopping experience in Nairobi. </p>

        <p>Without experiencing the nightlife, a trip to any city or town is usually incomplete. In my younger years, I spent a lot of time enjoying late nights out in Nairobi and I can say from experience that the nightlife is truly excellent.
           Exploring Nairobi at night is great, and it’s a fun and exciting way to experience the local culture.
           You can indulge in nighttime activities like partying, board gaming, karaoke, dancing, watching plays, or listening to live bands.
           Try out local food like Nyama Choma and Kachumbari, drink Tusker beer, (an East African pale lager), and create some moments to remember by joining this amazing Nairobi nightlife experience.</p>
        
        <h1>Nairobi National Museum</h1>
        <img id="img1" src="https://museums.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/slider-NMK.png" alt="" />
        <p>Museums are places of discovery, contemplation and learning: The Institution of National Museums of Kenya is anchored on four pillars notably culture, history, arts and nature. The Nairobi National Museum is only 20 minutes from the Central Business District.
           Historical Background
           The Museum was initiated in 1910 by a group of enthusiastic naturalists under the then East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society [currently the East African Natural History Society (EANHS)], who needed a place to keep and preserve their collections of various specimens. The first site for the Museum was at the present Nyayo House, which later became too small and a larger building was put up in 1922 where the Nairobi Serena Hotel stands today.
           In 1929, the colonial government set aside land for a Museum construction at Museum Hill which was officially opened in 22nd September, 1930 and named Coryndon Museum in honour of Sir Robert Coryndon, one-time Governor of Kenya. In 1963 after independence, it was re-named the National Museum of Kenya (NMK).
           On October 15th 2005, the Nairobi Museum closed its doors to the public for an extensive modernization and expansion project the outcome of which was an impressive and magnificent piece of architecture that puts it in competition with other world- class Museums. The Museum later re-opened in June 2008 as the Nairobi National Museum, and continues to draw visitors from all walks of life in appreciation of Kenya’s rich heritage.
           Attraction Points
           The Museum hosts both temporary and permanent galleries that attract learners and tourists alike. We have the following permanent galleries: The Cradle of human kind gallery; The Story of mammals; The History of Kenya; Cycles of life gallery; Numismatic exhibition and Asian African Heritage exhibition gallery respectively.
           Cradle of Human Kind gallery
           In the Cradle of human kind gallery, visitors interact first hand with early man and Stone Age tools. Bird’s gallery depicts the diversity of birds of East Africa arranged in family groups such as birds of prey, water birds and sunbirds. This helps visitors to envision on the different ways birds are adapted to their environment and feeding.
           Story of Mammals Gallery
           The story of mammals from the large elephant, bats to shrews is captured in three themes namely, evolution, locomotion, feeding adaptation and defense mechanism.
           The History of Kenya gallery
           The History of Kenya gallery details the origin of Kenya’s different communities and language groups, pre-colonial period, colonial period, interaction among the communities, struggle for independence and independence.
           Cycles of Life gallery
           Cycles of life gallery paints a picture of the different social interactions, and cultural activities during the life stages of man from childhood, youth, adulthood and ancestral stage. Learners get to interact with traditional items from different communities.
           Numismatic Exhibition
           Numismatic exhibition exposes the aspect of trade and exchange, the history of banking and the application of digital technology in trade and banking. Current currencies and various historical currencies are displayed as well as an interactive program on banking that encourages young children to learn best saving practices.
           The Museum aims to interpret Kenya’s rich heritage and offers a one stop for visitors to sample the country’s rich heritage both for education and leisure. In addition to the Museum, visitors are treated to a variety of shopping and dining facilities, as well as botanical gardens that offer a serene environment.
           Admission Hours
           Monday to Sunday: 8:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m. All year round including public holidays and weekends.
           Night Tours
           Exclusive for organized groups for a minimum of 10 people, a request can now be made through advance bookings for night tours.

        <h1>Maasai Ostrich Farm</h1>
        <img id="img2" src="https://www.maasaiostrichfarm.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/ostrich.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p> The Maasai Ostrich Farm, which is East African’s largest commercial hub for ostrich farming, was established in 1991. Named after the semi-nomadic ethnic group living in the area, the farm ships feathers, meat, skins, and live ostrich throughout Kenya and abroad.
            Around 1000 birds of two breeds are maintained: the blue-neck or Somali ostrich and the Maasai ostrich, which has a pink neck and legs.Ostrich is one of the largest living species of bird in the world. Ostriches are known for their amazingly long necks, lofty heights, two toes and large eye ball. Male ostriches also known as cocks, are identified by their rigorous display dances swinging their passionate pink necks sideways. Come and dance to the tune of a Maasai Ostrich at the farm.
            Ostrich feather is used as a court symbol of justice in Egypt due to the uniform arrangement of barbs. We present to our guest an opportunity to own the feather and even buy feather articles. Maasai ostrich farm provides the guest with a unique and memorable experience. One gets to experience nature teaming with ostriches and various products attached to such sub species of bird.</p>
        
        <h1>Nairobi Elephant Orphanage</h1>
        <img id="img2" src="https://www.heleninwonderlust.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nairobi-13-1.png" alt=""/>
        <p>If you love elephants (especially baby ones), you’re going to love the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, (formerly the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust) a rehabilitation centre for abandoned or orphaned baby elephants (and other animals, occasionally rhinos) who are too young to survive in the wild on their own.
           The elephant orphanage in Nairobi was started by the late Dame Daphne Sheldrick in memory of her late husband, David, a legendary ranger of Tsavo National Park. The elephants are cared for and then released back into the wild when they are old enough.
           Visitors are allowed in at 11 a.m. each day for approximately 1 hour to see the elephants and listen to a talk by one of the keepers. Sometimes the baby elephants come up to say hello and I’ve had my foot trodden on many times! You can adopt a baby elephant for as little as £35 a year which also gives you access to visit outside of the usual hours.</p>
