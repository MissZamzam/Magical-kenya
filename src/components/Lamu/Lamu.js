        <h1>Lamu Island</h1>
            
        <p>Brimming with intriguing history, natural beauty, and amenities for every travel style, but set apart from the tourist crowds? Then Lamu Island certainly deserves a close look!
           Located a mere two hours by air from bustling Nairobi, arriving on the UNESCO-designated island may feel like you’ve journeyed to the edge of the world – and back in time as well.
           Cars? Not on Lamu Island. Instead, expect to find plenty of donkeys plying the narrow alleyways of this ancient settlement.
           International restaurant and hotel chains? Nope. But you will find a wide range of accommodation, from basic homestay-style guesthouses to luxury boutique hotels just steps from white sands beaches – plus, a sumptuous mix of Swahili and other regional cuisine and locally-owned international-style cafes, bars, and restaurants.
           And that’s just the beginning!</p>

        <h1>The Ancient Alleyways of Lamu Old Town</h1>
        <img id="img1" src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/3e/5c/8c/photo7jpg.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&s=1" alt="" />
        <p>With its seemingly endless stretch of golden sands and tasteful assortment of coral heritage guesthouses, portions of Lamu Island (particularly Shela Village and the south coast) evoke a beach-lover’s paradise.
           But Lamu Island is so much more than an East Africa beach destination!
           At the heart of this stunning and largely uninhabited island is the extraordinarily atmospheric ancient Swahili settlement of Lamu Town (aka Old Town).
           Move over Zanzibar Stone Town, Lamu Old Town is the oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlement in all of East Africa, having been a key settlement for trade since the 14th century.
           Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001, this town of coral stone and timber, with its vast network of narrow alleyways, evokes the important Swahili trade settlement of centuries past.
           Be sure to save plenty of time for wandering historic Old Town, exploring its evocative historic sites and interesting shops and galleries, chatting with quirky and insightful local residents, and admiring the many striking mosques (there are around 40 of them on this small island!).
           After nightfall, Old Town comes alive, as residents spill out from their homes to enjoy the lovely Kenyan Coast evening. Don’t miss a stroll around during this part of the day for a true slice of everyday life on Lamu Island.</p>
        
   
        <h1>Staying in a Swahili Coral Mansion</h1>
        <img id="img2" src="https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/A5236-An-overview-of-Swahili-Architecture-Image-3.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>The number of excellent lodging options on Lamu Island has grown in the past decade, and many older guesthouses continue to tastefully renovate and improve their offerings and amenities for guests.
           While there are numerous lodging options at nearly every price point, historic Swahili mansions converted into boutique guesthouses offer the quintessential Lamu stay that many visitors come here hoping to find.
           In many cases, these guesthouses are carefully preserved and painstakingly refurbished former residences of the island’s former elite, originally constructed of blocks hewn from coral.</p>

        <h1>Swahili Coastal Cuisine</h1>
        <img id="img1" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/20/83/fe/2083fee6910871b174eb5a72882bfdb0.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>An eclectic and satisfying mix of dining and drinking options is yet another reason excellent reason to visit Lamu Island.
           No doubt, Swahili cuisine is king here, and you generally can’t go wrong ordering up the specialty of the day from a crowded local eatery.
           But the island also hosts several excellent cafes and restaurants serving German, Swedish, Mediterranean, French, Italian, and even Bosnian cuisine – and more!
           Historic Lamu and sleepy Shela also have small, low-key pockets of nightlife. But do note, this is a predominately Muslim community, so you won’t find as many cafes and eateries serving alcohol as you might find elsewhere in Kenya.
           Here are just a few suggestions of places to try while you are on Lamu Island:
           LOCAL (SWAHILI) CUISINE ▸ For popular Swahili offerings and local favorites in Old Town, don’t miss Seafront Cafe (on the waterfront near Lamu Fort), Mangrove Restaurant (near the Museum Jetty) and Umalila (next to Lamu House Hotel). Stop Over (along the Corniche Path, halfway to Shela) is one of our personal favorites. For something completely different, don’t miss dinner or a drink on the Floating Restaurant (located in the channel between the Museum Jetty and hospital).
           INTERNATIONAL CUISINE ▸ If you’re in the mood for a taste of home (or something a bit more exotic, depending on where you are from), check out Whispers Coffeeshop for “Western” delights and Moonrise Restaurant (formerly Lamu Beach Club) in Lamu House Hotel. In Shela Village, Peponi Hotel Restaurant for excellent European and seafood dishes with seafront seating, and Kijani Rooftop Restaurant for excellent international cuisine with a view.</p>
       
        <h1>Historic Landmarks & Points of Interest</h1>
        <img id="img2" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iuLnY5AKo7k/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>There are several historic landmarks and museums worth seeing on the island and beyond.
           Arabs, Persians, Portuguese, Chinese, Germans, British and Bantu Africans have all made indelible marks on Lamu, which is reflected in the island’s culture and architecture.
           The primary religion is overwhelmingly Muslim — there are over 40 mosques on the small island! (nearly a dozen in the town center — which becomes sort of a “Battle of the Mosques” at prayer time, with the various Muezzins all calling out over the loudspeakers simultaneously (sometimes even at 4am!).
           A few points of interest that should be on your short list of places to visit in Lamu Island out are:
           LAMU WATERFRONT ▸ The Old Town waterfront has changed little in the past century, particularly the stretch of the Corniche Path just north and south of the Museum Jetty. This is one of the best places to get a sense of what this trading settlement might have been like in its heyday on a leisurely sunrise/sunset stroll.
           LAMU FORT ▸ Lamu Fort has long been at the center of daily life in Lamu since its construction in the early 19th century. It was here that the Sultan of Oman consolidated his power in East Africa, greatly increasing Lamu’s prominence before its eventual decline following the Sultan’s relocation to Zanzibar. The Fort served as a prison through much of the 20th century, and currently serves as a cultural exhibition hall and museum.
           RIYADHA MOSQUE ▸ Dating to 1900, Riyadha Mosque is one of the most prominent in town for its esteemed Centre for Islamic Studies and for hosting the annual Maulidi Festival – where pilgrims come from across East Africa to join in prayers and compete in donkey races and dhow-sailing events.
           LAMU DONKEY SANCTUARY ▸ By some estimates, there are as many as 6,000 donkeys on Lamu Island. Yet, until fairly recently there were few services on the island to care for the health and wellbeing of Lamu’s beloved workhorses…or work-donkeys, so to speak. In 1987, that changed with the opening of the Donkey Sanctuary, which provides free treatment to the island’s donkeys.
           THE FORT OF SHELA ▸ At the water line just south of Shela Village, one might easily mistake the imposing garrison-like structure perched on the point as a historic Omani stronghold. But in fact the impressive Fort of Shela is a much more contemporary structure (c. 2001) dreamed up by an Italian aristocrat. Following his death, his wife transformed their incredible home into a luxury hotel.</p>
       
        <h1>Lamu Fort</h1>
        <img id="img1" src="https://www.islamicarchitecturalheritage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lamu-fort.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>he buildings of Lamu Old Town, the oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlement in East Africa, are constructed in coral stone and mangrove timber. The town is located on the island of Lamu, on the African East coast, some 250km north of Mombasa. Founded in or before the 14th century, like Kilwa, Zanzibar and other Swahili ports, a trading centre with a prominent role in the slavetrade. Lamu Old Town has maintained much of its traditional atmosphere with narrow streets and Swahili architecture which combines Swahili, Arabic, Persian, Indian and European building elements.
           The Lamu Fort, built between 1813-1821 by Omanis, served to protect Omani interest along the East African coast. From 1910 to 1984 it was used as a prison. Today Lamu Island has become an important centre for the study of Swahili and Islamic cultures. Lamu Old Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
           The Zamani Project team visited Lamu Island on a field campaign in 2006 and spatially documented Lamu Fort, as well as the Swahili House Museum and the nearby Shela Mosque.

       <h1>Takwa Ruins</h1>
       <img id="img2" src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/cb/3c/23/provided-by-museums-of.jpg?w=1200&h=-1&s=1" alt=""/>
       <p>The ruins of Takwa are located on the south eastern corner of Manda Island Lamu District in Coast province. A 30 minute boat ride from Lamu Town.
          Takwa ruins are the remains of a thriving 15th and 16th century Swahili trading town before it was abandoned in the seventeenth century. It is not only important because of its period of occupation but also because of its dense settlement and its relatively well preserved remains. The unique Friday Mosque with a large pillar a top the qibla wall is among the most notable features. This pillar is believed to symbolize the burial of a Sheikh be low the wall.
          The position of the site at the narrowest location on the whole island, was most probably a strategy. Takwa’s position/location with shallow waters must have been of considerable importance especially during its peak, when many of the sails that came into view were likely to be hostile.Therefore access to the site must have been primarily from the shallow channel which could only admit vessels of shallow draft.
          Takwa eventual abandonment in the 17th century was due to salination of the once fresh water and endless fighting between Takwa and Pate people. These ruins were gazetted as a National Monument in 1982 in Gazette notice No. 1514. At present, Takwa is open daily to the Public. It is a very pleasant place for a casual visit, which can be complimented by a picnic and overnight camping.</p>
    
    
      <h1>The Fort of Shela</h1>
      <img id="img1" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5b9a6a52a9e02884bac7536b/1562332894526-JEEJ98C92B5VILFM0VQ0/thefortshela_rosalia_8759.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p>Nestled along the sand dunes of Shela Beach, The Fort has been hailed as a monument to Omani architectural ingenuity. Built in 2001, the landmark is the epitome of privacy and seclusion. Its unique architecture occupies an unrivaled position overlooking the Indian Ocean on the deserted 14 kilometre beach.
         Peaceful and tranquil in it’s setting, surrounded by natural dunes and breezy casuarinas, The Fort is an elegant and unique sanctuary offering privacy combined with personalized hospitality. Extremely private and secure, this oasis is just a ten minute walk along the beach to Shela Village.
         The Fort is constructed of local coral stone and is enclosed by an imposing 50-foot high sandstone wall. The Omani style heavy wooden entrance doors, decorated with iron studs, open onto the main floor of the property, where large arches surround the central courtyard. The living area, lower dining area and lounge look onto the aesthetic pool and the beautiful garden.
         From the upstairs formal dining area, guests can enjoy spectacular views of the Indian Ocean as traditional dhows sail by and donkeys and camels cruise the beach. Peering out at the pristine Shela Beach one is reminded that time here has stopped.
         The Fort comes with a full staff to take care of all of your needs and desires. We can arrange day excursions to Lamu Town, neighboring islands, as well as fishing, snorkeling and sailing trips.</p>
        
      <h1>Manda Toto</h1>
      <img id="img2" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EEAJUIsWsAAIJLf.jpg" alt=""/>
      <p>TManda Toto is the small offshore island of Manda Island. Unsurprisingly, the name of this desert island in the Lamu archipelago means literally “Child of Manda”.
         If you are looking for nature, dream beaches and complete solitude, you will not be disappointed on Manda Toto, as it is almost as idyllic as it can get here. As is the case on the main island of Manda, there is no fresh water on Manda Toto and here there is nothing but unspoilt nature, but that does of course mean that you have to bring your own food and drink.
         You will find dream beaches in the north of Manda Toto on both sides of the small island. These are especially spacious at low tide when you might even be able to walk to the main island of Manda. Manda Bay can be reached by boat from Lamu, but the trip is not cheap because of the high petrol prices on the Lamu archipelago. However, the journey passes by mangrove forests which are the natural habitat for many different kinds of animals and well worth seeing.
