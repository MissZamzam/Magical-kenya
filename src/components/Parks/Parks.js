          National Park welcomes you to take a walk amidst the free-ranging
          African elephants. Crowned by the highest peak of Africa, Mount
          Kilimanjaro, this National Reserve occupies 39,206 hectares of land
          and spreads across the Kenya-Tanzania border. The name Amboseli is
          derived from a Maasai word that means ‘Salty dust’. The parched
          condition of this national park goes perfectly with its name. Major
          wildlife spotted during the Amboseli National Park safari is a
          cheetah, lion, waterbuck, eland, impala, giraffe, etc. The most
          amazing Amboseli National Park fact is that it houses more than 600
          different species of birds. Interacting with the local Maasai people
          residing around the park is also an experience of a lifetime. The
          major attractions in Amboseli national park are Elephant research
          camp- The research camp is established at the heart of the park for
          the research of African elephants. It requires prior permission to
          enter the research camp. Normatior(Observation hill)- The Pyramid
          shaped hill allows you to enjoy the wildlife view. Amboseli Lake- Most
          of North West of the park is occupied by this lake. It generally
          remains dry except heavy rain. Sinet Delta- Popular for bird watching.
          The most of the population in Amboseli is Massai tribe. They are the
          only traditional inhabitant of this area and their foods, customs and
          culture are still unique and also displayed in most of the resorts.
          Amboseli National Park is approximately 240 kilometers away from
          Nairobi. You may visit Amboseli by driving or you may avail of a
          flight from Nairobi. You may visit Amboseli anytime in the year;
          however, it is preferable to visit in the dry season, which is June to

        <p>
          Lake Bogoria, lying slightly north of the equator, is a
          saline-alkaline lake. It is situated amidst a half-barren land in a
          volcanic region to the southern part of Lake Baringo. The world’s
          largest population of the famous lesser flamingos can be spotted in
          Lake Bogoria just like in Lake Nakuru. This lake falls under the
          Ramsar treaty and within the lake lies, the protected National Reserve
          named the Lake Bogoria National Reserve. The drainage basin of the
          lake covers an area of 700 sq. km. The National Reserve within the
          lake, houses features like the Swamp Kesubo in the North and the
          Siracho Escarpment in the east. Hot springs and geysers are also
          popular attractions within the lake. The main attraction of the lake
          is flamingos and eyewitness spooky evidence of the ongoing tumult
          beneath Earth’s surface. In the early morning, the steam coming from
          Brogoria’sGeysar forms a mistry. A rare animal greater kudu is also
          found in Bogoria. It has wide ears, vertical white striped body, and a
          tell-tale white chevron between the eyes. It can be easily identified
          by its large spiral horns. The lake can also offer you to see Grant’s
          gazelle, Kirk’s dik-dik, baboon, buffaloes, etc. The lake is highly
          alkaline and twice as salty as seawater, it can’t support fish however
          it contains an unusual array of microbes and microorganisms from which
          enzymes are being produced. The enzymes can be used as antibiotics,
          cleaning products. Bogoria has spiritual and cultural worth for
          Endorosis people, who are living beside Bogoria Lake for centuries.{" "}

        <h1>Lake Naivasha</h1>

          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          Lake Naivasha derives its name from the Maasai word for ‘rough water’
          due to the sudden storms that are known to arise in the area. Easily
          accessible from Nairobi, the lake is a refreshing day trip or weekend
          break from Kenya’s busy capital. Located in Nakuru County, Lake
          Naivasha is a large freshwater lake which sits just outside the town
          of Naivasha. Situated at an elevation of 1,884m, Lake Naivasha is the
          highest lake within the Great Rift Valley. With a surface area of
          139km², Lake Naivasha dominates the landscape, and it is surrounded by
          a swamp which covers an area of around 64km². Beyond the swampland,
          the lake is encircled by forests of the fever tree. Lake Naivasha’s
          surface area depends on rainfall and the lake dried up completely in
          the early c.20th. Lake Naivasha is easily accessible from Nairobi and
          the 98km journey takes around 2.5 hours along the Old Naivasha Road
          and the C88. Naivasha’s proximity to the capital makes it a popular
          day trip, and the lake can get busy at the weekend. If you want to
          avoid the crowds, you should visit during the week or spend a few days
          in the area during as part of a wider itinerary. Lake Naivasha is a
          short distance from Hell's Gate National Park and a taxi journey
          should take less than an hour. Some travellers choose to pair these
          attractions. Lake Naivasha is equidistant between Nakuru and Nairobi,
          and it is easily accessible from both cities or a suitable halfway
          point if travelling between Nakuru and Nairobi.

          Welcome to Kenya’s most accessible yet incongruous safari experience.
          Set on the city’s southern outskirts, Nairobi National Park (at 117 sq
          km, one of Africa’s smallest) has abundant wildlife that can, in
          places, be viewed against a backdrop of city skyscrapers and planes
          coming in to land – it's one of the only national parks on earth
          bordering a capital city. Remarkably, the animals seem utterly
          unperturbed by it all. The park has acquired the nickname ‘Kifaru
          Ark’, a testament to its success as a rhinoceros (kifaru in Kiswahili)
          sanctuary. The park is home to the world's densest concentration of
          black rhinos (more than 50), though even the park's strong
          antipoaching measures couldn't prevent poachers from killing one of
          the rhinos in August 2013 and then again in January 2014. They were
          the first such attacks in six years, and reflect the current sky-high
          Asian black-market price for rhino horn. Lions and hyenas are also
          commonly sighted within the park; rangers at the entrance usually have
          updates on lion movements. You’ll need a bit of patience and a lot of
          luck to spot the park’s resident cheetahs and leopards. Other
          regularly spotted species include gazelles, warthogs, zebras,
          giraffes, ostriches and buffaloes. The park’s wetland areas sustain
          approximately 400 bird species, which is more than in the whole of the
          UK. Matatus (minibuses) 125 and 126 (KSh50, 30 to 45 minutes) pass by
          the main park entrance from the train station. You can also go by
          private vehicle. Nairobi tour companies offer half-day safaris (from
          US$75 per person). Apart from the main entrance, which lies 7km from
          the city centre, there are other gates on Magadi Rd and the Athi River
          gate; the latter is handy if you’re continuing on to Mombasa, Amboseli
          or the Tanzanian border. The roads in the park are passable with 2WDs,
          but travelling in a 4WD is never a bad idea, especially if the rains
          have been heavy. Unless you already have your own vehicle, the
          cheapest way to see the park is on the shuttle, a big Kenya Wildlife
          Service (KWS) bus that leaves the main gate at 2pm on Sunday for a
          2½-hour tour. You need to book in person at the main gate by 1.30pm,
          but do call ahead if you want to do the tour, as times can change.{" "}

          Tsavo West National Park. Located in Coast Province of Kenya in
          between Nairobi City and Mombasa. Tsavo is nearly 22,000km2, being the
          largest national park in Kenya and one of the largest in the world.
          The park was split into two due to the railway going from Mombasa to
          the interior of Kenya. Accommodation: There are plenty of places to
          stay in the two parks. These range greatly and most of them have a
          water hole close to the property making game viewing easier. Size:
          Tsavo East National Park is one of the oldest parks in Kenya, located
          South East of Kenya near the Town of Voi in the Taita-Taveta District
          of Coast Province, inland from the Coast, it is 13,747 sq.km. While
          the Tsavo West National Park is also located in the Coast Province of
          Kenya covering an area of 9,065 sq.km. The park was opened in April
          1948. Tsavo East Features The slightly larger Tsavo East is generally
          flat, with dry plains across which the Galana River flows. Other
          features include the Yatta Plateau and Lugard Falls. Tsavo West
          Features Tsavo West National Park is more mountainous and wetter than
          its counterpart, with swamps, Lake Jipe and the Mzima Springs. It is
          known for bird life and for its large mammal’s e.g. black rhino, Cape
          buffalo, elephant, leopard, hippo and Masai lion. There are also other
          smaller animals that can be spotted in the park, such as the bush
          baby, hartebeest, lesser kudu and Maasai giraffe. Access: The parks
          can be accessed through several gates. Tsavo East can be accessed
          trough Manyani Gate, Voi Gate, Buchuma Gate and Sala Gate. Tsavo West
          can be aaccessed through Mtito Gate, Man Eaters Gate, Chyulu Gate and
          one other near Maktau. Tsavo National Park is one of the main tourist
          destinations in Kenya and is located in the southwestern part of
          Kenya. Tsavo is divided into 2 having Tsavo East National Park & Tsavo
          West National Park. The park is known for having quite a number of
          Lions that were sometime termed as the “Man-Eaters” and other animal
          species like the large herds of elephants. The park measures 13,747
          square kilometers. Tsavo national park is one of the oldest national
          parks in Kenya which is located in the southeastern part of the
          country and it is made up of Tsavo west national park and Tsavo east
          national park which are separated by a railway line. Famous for
          man-eating lions, Tsavo national park also consist of a rugged
          landscape which is also made up of mountains as well as wooded
          grasslands in Tsavo west national park. In contrast, Tsavo east
          national park is characterized by semiarid grasslands and savannah
          where wildlife species can be seen. The man-eating lions in Tsavo
          national park came to be known as above when two maneless lions
          attacked construction workers during the construction of the railway
          passing through the national park. These lions are among the
          attractions that tourists visiting this national park are interested
          in seeing as they explore the destination.{" "}

          Hell’s Gate National Park is located in the southern part of Kenya
          just northwest of Nairobi. The national park encompasses an area of
          26.35 square miles (68.25 sq km). Hell’s Gate borders up to the sister
          Lake Nakuru National Park. The park is only 56 miles (90 km) from
          Nairobi sitting at an elevation of 6,200 feet (1,900 m) above sea
          level. Hell’s Gate Gorge is the main attraction and basis for the
          park’s name. Red walled cliffs travel along the gorge and feature two
          volcanic rock formations known as Fischer’s Tower and Central Tower. A
          smaller gorge trails away from Central Tower and leads to an area of
          hot springs. The springs are hot enough to cause burns. There are two
          extinct volcanoes known as Olkaria and Hobley’s found with the park
          boundaries. Hell’s Gate is a popular national park in Kenya because of
          its easy access from Nairobi as well as the variety of wildlife and
          amazing landscapes that can be experienced with a visit to the park.
          The wildlife numbers are smaller, but the variety of wildlife is
          abundant. Some of the predator species include lion, leopard, hyena,
          serval, and cheetah. Other popular species include zebra, eland,
          buffalo, hartebeest, klipspringer, reedbuck, hyraxes, and Thomson’s
          gazelle. There are more than 100 species of birds with some of the
          larger species including the Verreaux eagle, augur buzzard, and
          vultures including the rare lammergeyer vulture. From a cultural
          perspective, the park facilities include a Maasai Cultural Center
          where visitors can learn about the Maasai tribe customs, traditions,
          and overall culture. This is an excellent educational opportunity to
          learn more about an amazing group of people with unique customs and
          practices. Everything about Hell’s Gate National Park is different.
          You can take a guided walking safari here. In fact, it’s encouraged.
          And where else can you do a bicycle safari, riding past grazing zebra,
          giraffe, impala, buffalo and baboon. The opportunities for climbing
          are plentiful, accessible and not too challenging on the park’s
          volcanic spires. And the land here is striking as well, greeting
          visitors with dramatic gorges, great towers, looming cliffs and
          steaming columns of geothermal clouds escaping from the rocks. Hell’s
          Gate indeed! But the park is actually quite tranquil and safe, very
          suitable for hiking, biking and family exploration. Though there are
          populations of the larger hunters like lion, leopard and cheetah,
          their numbers are small and sightings rare, so you can walk or ride in
          peace, enjoying closeup views of eland, hartebeest, gazelle, antelope
          and over 130 species of birds. The park is also a sanctuary for the
          rare bearded or lammergeyer vulture and Verreaux’s eagle. Plus, there
          are opportunities here to view these raptors up close. Named for a
          great gash in its sheer red cliffs and its steamy geothermal billows,
          Hell’s Gate features three geothermal stations, the first in Africa.
          Lying beneath Hell’s Gate, the plants generate power from the constant
          energy flowing off the hot springs and geysers. With its three
          campsites, camping is safe and encouraged as is bicycling and even
          motorcycling. There are also plenty of opportunities for climbers
          along the sandstone gorges and volcanic towers. And being just a short
          drive from Nairobi, Hell’s Gate is an ideal day trip for hiking, game
          viewing, enjoying the hot springs and even visiting its health spa.
          After a vigorous morning of hiking or biking you can take a lunch
          break here at a neighboring restaurant and enjoy the local Kenyan
          cuisine. And trips to nearby Crescent Island Preserve and Lakes
          Naivasha and Nakuru are easily arranged.

        <p>
          The Aberdare National Park in the central highlands of Kenya retains
          an air of mystery - you can only imagine what undiscovered creatures
          still lurk here, such as rare Black Leopards. The Aberdares are an
          isolated volcanic range that forms the eastern wall of the rift
          valley, running about 100 Km north south between Nairobi and Thompsons
          Falls. This beautifully scenic region is much cooler than the
          savannahs and offers a completely different perspective on the
          country. The national park lies mainly above the tree line. The
          scenery is spectacular with its mountainous terrain covered in thick
          tropical forests swathed in mist. The Experience The experience in
          Aberdare National Park is unlike anywhere else in Kenya. The Park is
          most famous as the place where Princess Elizabeth found out that she
          was Queen upon the death of her father at Treetops Lodge. Since then
          this lodge has been popular with tourists on safari to Kenya. Half the
          thrill of game viewing in this park is an Elephant or Buffalo suddenly
          appearing out of the thick rainforest vegetation. One of the best
          places to see the local denizens is at one of the waterholes by the
          lodge. The Park has several high mountain peaks, deep ravines with icy
          mountain streams and many beautiful waterfalls with a moorland
          plateau. You can explore the park while on game drives and trek up the
          high peaks and take in the spectacular scenery. The thick rainforest
          gives way to bamboo forest and interesting alpine vegetation the
          higher you travel up the mountain peaks within the park. The forest is
          home to populations of forest Elephants, Buffalo, Lion and several
          species of antelope such as Waterbuck, Duiker, the rare Suni and
          Bushbuck. If you are very lucky you might catch a glimpse of Kenya's
          rarest antelope, the Bongo. The Park is also home to a healthy
          population of Black Rhino. Serval and Leopard also occur some of which
          have a rare black coat. There are many species of primates, including
          Black and White Colobus and Sykes and Vervet Monkey's.{" "}

          It’s the second highest mountain in Africa. It borders the equator,
          yet it supports 12 glaciers, plus pristine lakes, tarns and dense
          alpine forest. This is Mt. Kenya National Park – a land and a world
          away from all the other national parks. The climbing is excellent, as
          is the camping. And when the mists burn off, the vistas are
          magnificent. Here, in this UNESCO World Heritage Site you can begin
          your trek in tropical forest, spotting buffalo and elephant. You’ll
          then ascend to bamboo forest perhaps spotting Colubus and other
          monkeys. You can also find antelope and giant forest hogs in this
          dense wooded terrain. Your trek continues into alpine moorlands which
          will present bizarre flora like the towering giant lobelia. As you
          advance up the mountain, you’ll move into glacier country – a barren
          moonscape of rock, ice and snow. Finally, you’ll arrive at the
          pinnacle of this extinct volcano overseeing sweeping views of the
          Kenyan highlands. This, of course, is the main draw of Mt. Kenya Park
          – the chance to climb a lofty summit rising above the heat and
          savannahs of Africa and partake in the deep wilderness panorama. A
          Park Like No Other There were several important reasons for
          establishing this park in 1949. Mt. Kenya itself, the surrounding
          wildlife and its environment were all in need of the protections a
          park designation would bring. Plus, the area is a major catchment of
          water supplying several large river systems in Kenya. Long a favorite
          of climbers, the stately mountain has 7 routes to the summit. Of Mt.
          Kenya’s 3 peaks – Batian (5199m/17,057 ft), Nelion (5188m/17,021 ft)
          and Point Lenana (4985m/16,354 ft) – only this last can be ascended by
          regular visitors. The other taller peaks remain in the realm of
          advanced technical mountaineers. Climbing at these elevations can be
          challenging and it is recommended that climbers spend a minimum of 3
          nights to acclimatise to prevent altitude sickness. Beginning your
          climb at the mountain’s tropical base, you’ll be welcomed by the
          park’s prolific birdlife. As you trek up through the forests and
          moors, watch for sunbirds, eagles and other avian life in this
          towering park.{" "}

          Lake Nakuru National Park is located in the southwestern part of
          Kenya, northwest of Nairobi. The national park encompasses an area of
          73 square miles (188 sq km). It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site
          celebrating the flamingos and abundant wildlife. Lake Nakuru is the
          foundation of the park serving as a wildlife haven. The maximum depth
          is only 6 feet (1.8 m) with an average depth of 1 foot (.30 m) making
          it easy for animals to access. It is one of the Rift Valley lakes
          sitting at an elevation of 5,755 feet (1,754 m) above sea level.
          Nakuru is an alkaline lake, which is what further draws birds and
          wildlife to its shores. The national park and lake are most renowned
          for the tens of thousands of flamingos which can reach over a million
          at their peak. The best place to view the view flamingos is from
          Baboon Cliff. The serene landscapes of the area include grasslands,
          marsh, outcrops, rocky cliffs, and sedge. Yellow-barked acacia trees
          add to the traditional African wilderness experience. An area around
          116 miles (188 km) has been fenced to create a protected area for both
          black and white rhinoceroses as well as giraffes. The park features
          about 70 white rhinos and another 25 eastern black rhinos. It is one
          of the largest collections of rhinos throughout Kenya. Wildlife is
          bountiful with a populous predator presence to reflect the abundance
          of prey. Predator species include lion, cheetah, leopard, and hyenas.
          Large pythons might be found as well. Giraffe and the two species of
          rhino are mammalian highlights however there are several other
          species. The waterbuck is more common than in other parks. There is a
          small number of hippo that can be found along the reeds of the lake.
          Along with the waterbuck, visitors might also see Reedbuck and
          Bushbuck. Birdwatchers can hope to see African fish eagle, Verreaux’s
          eagle, Goliath heron, kingfisher, and of course an abundance of
          flamingos. It is a spectacular place for birdwatching with over 400
          species. There are over a dozen different predator bird species. The
          flamingo population has earned the lake and national park the slogan,
          “the greatest bird spectacle on earth.” The shallow lake is rich in
          algae and according attracts the flamingos who eat around 551,155
          pounds (250,000 kg) of algae per acre a year. Lake Nakuru National
          Park is only 102 miles (164 km) away from Nairobi making it easy to
          make a day trip out of the city to experience this amazing encounter
          with wildlife.{" "}
