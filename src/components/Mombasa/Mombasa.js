        <h1>Fort Jesus Museum</h1>
        <img id="img1" src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/KEN/kenya-mombasa-fort-jesus.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>The Portuguese built Fort Jesus in 1593. The site chosen was a coral ridge at the entrance to the harbor. An Italian Architect and Engineer, Batista Cairato designed the Fort. The earliest known plan of the fort is in a manuscript atlas by Manuel Godinho de Heredia – dated 1610 that shows the original layout of the buildings inside the Fort.

            The Portuguese regarded themselves as the representatives of the Christendom rather than of Portugal, and as a result, they sailed under the flag of the order of Christ, Jesus was therefore an obvious name for the new fort. Fort Jesus was built to secure the safety of Portuguese living on the East Coast of Africa. It has had a long history of hostilities of the interested parties that used to live in Mombasa. Perhaps no Fort in Africa has experienced such turbulence as Fort Jesus.

            Omani Arabs attacked the fort from 1696 to 1698. The state of the fort can be understood from the plan of Rezende of 1636 and other plans by Don Alvaro Marquis of Cienfuegos and Jose Lopes de Sa – made during the brief reoccupation by the Portuguese in 1728 – 1729. In the Cienfuegos plan, the names of the bastions are changed. Between 1837 and 1895, the Fort was used as barracks for the soldiers. When the British protectorate was proclaimed on 1st July 1895, the Fort was converted into a prison. The huts were removed and cells were built.

            On 24th October 1958, Fort Jesus was declared a National Park in the custody of the Trustees of the Kenya National Parks. Excavation was carried out and the fort became a Museum in 1962. The Fort Jesus Museum was built with a grant from the Gulbenkian Foundation. The exhibits consist of findings from archaeological excavations at Fort Jesus, Gede, Manda, Ungwana and other sites. Individuals notably; Mrs. J.C. White, Mr. C.E. Whitton and Mrs. W.S. Marchant donated other objects on display. In 2011, it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and highlighted as one of the most outstanding and well-preserved examples of 16th-century Portuguese military fortifications.
            Fort Jesus has preserved the same basic shape as when it was built nearly 400 years ago. It bears physical witness, in its structures and subsequent transformations, also to the interchange of cultural values and influences between and among peoples of African, Arab, Turkish, Persian and European origin that fought to gain and maintain their control over this strategic port.

            Currently, the Fort is also used to show case art exhibitions for upcoming artists enabling them to meet their prospective clients who tour the Fort. A sound and light show is organized weekly, which tells an animated story of the fort to both local and international tourists. The site is located in Mombasa Island which is in the coast of Kenya</p>        
        
        <h1>Haller Park</h1>
        <img id="img2" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTvamHBHll8GfLnPidmvO_quINuNYS1pE7R_A&usqp=CAU" alt="" />
        <p>The Bamburi Portland Cement Company opened a limestone quarry just outside Mombasa in 1954. By 1971, the quarry had left an ugly gaping hole on the scenery of Mombasa, which concerned the management of the company. They decided then to try an experiment to reclaim the land and restore it back into an ecological wilderness. In 1983, the now commercially exhausted quarry, still left a scar on the landscape and the experiment continued.

            Findings found that the coastal limestone quarry, formed by ancient corals, is not a good substrate for growing new plants. Another problem encountered, was the water table. Being coastal, the water table is tidal, making the water very brackish. Finding plants that can survive poor soil and salty water was a challenge. Dr Haller, after spending many hours on the dusty floor of the quarry, found only a few ferns growing there.

            The first task then, was to find pioneer plants that could withstand the limestone desert, brackish water and poor soil. They must also be able to survive the harsh African sun. Twenty-six varieties of saplings were planted. Only three survived. Between 1971 and 1974, they planted some 12,000 tree saplings. After ten months of steady growth, some of the trees were looking decidedly unhealthy.

            After studying healthy trees in another environment, Dr. Haller found a solution - soil nitrates and microorganisms were missing from the near sterile soil. He inoculated the soil, fixed the atmospheric nitrogen, and the trees started to look healthier.

            They transplanted young tree saplings from government forests into the quarry. To avoid monoculture planting different types of trees were needed but consideration or their best use needed to be take into account too; timber for construction, poles or fence posts and for charcoal production later.

            Some 25 different kinds of trees, so far, have been planted and tested; eucalyptus, neem, algaroba, pinus, baobab, coconut, date palms, banana and mango trees to name a few. Dr Rene meticulously observed nature’s reactions and immediately applied appropriate measures that helped the reforestation process.

            Some of the trees are evergreen and shed their needles. These needles were difficult to break down, by the microorganisms, due to their high tannin content. Which caused the establishment of new growth to be slow too as the humus was not adequate.

            A lucky incident solved this problem, when the red-legged Mombasa trains (Epibolus pulchripes) happily started to feed on the dry needles. The compost bacteria in the millipedes’ droppings converted the needles into the needed humus. These useful animals, collected from coastal bushes, were an instant success as the millipedes multiplied fast in the young forest. The leaf litter slowly reduced and a layer of humus thickened underneath.

            The millipedes had found a land of milk and honey having the forest floor for them only but this happy state of affairs did not last long. Soon they became part of the food chain too, as white tailed mongooses and civets started eating millipedes as they came in the forest on their own.

            A forest ecosystem was beginning to form, next mushrooms started to appear in the darker moister patches of forest. Then termites, who cultivate fungi, started to build their mounds. Termites generally considered a pest, because they feed on soft timber for construction and furniture, in the quarry's forest ecosystem they play an important role as they eat almost any dead vegetation, in particular deadwood, bringing it underground and thus making it available to soil microorganisms.

            The termite’s task is comparable to the one of millipedes but they have an important advantage by mixing the soil substrate too.</p>

        <h1>Jumba la Mtwana</h1>
        <img id="img2" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Jumba_la_Mtwana-mosque_on_the_beach.jpg/1280px-Jumba_la_Mtwana-mosque_on_the_beach.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>The full name Jumba la Mtwana means in Swahili “the large house of the slave”. Within this area four mosques, a tomb and four houses have survived in recognizable condition. These houses include the House of the Cylinder, The House of the Kitchen, The House of the Many Pools, which had three phases, and the Great Mosque. The inhabitants of this town were mainly Muslims as evidenced by a number of ruined mosques.

            Jumba la Mtwana a picturesque ruined village is situated in Kilifi along the Kenyan coast. The site lies some 15 kilometers north of Mombasa on and above the beach some 1000 meters north of the mouth of Mtwapa creek; 4 kilometers from the Mombasa-Malindi road and extends along the shore for a distance of about 300 meters and 250 meters inland.

            There are no written historical records of the town but ceramic evidence showed that the town had been built in the fourteenth century but abandoned early in the fifteenth century. The dating is based on the presence of a few shreds of early blue and white porcelain with lung-chuan celadon, and the absence of any later Chinese wares.

            It is most likely the site’s strategic position was selected because of the presence of fresh water, exposure to the North East and South East breezes which would keep the people cool and its safe location from external attacks by sea since it had no harbor, thus larger vessels had to anchor along way offshore, or move probably in Mtwapa creek. One can only therefore guess reasons for its eventual desertion, namely trade interruption, hostile invasion or a failure in water supply.

            Clearance and excavation of the ruins were first carried out in 1972 by James Kirkman with a view of dating the buildings, its period of occupation and consolidating buildings which were in danger of collapse. Ten years later Jumba la Mtwana was gazetted on 04/06/82 Gazette Notice Number 1515 as a National Monument.</p>

        <p>Ever visited Nguu Tatu hill near Mombasa Kenya?One of the best attractions of mombasa area is a visit to Nguuni Nature Sanctuary. “What a fantastic place for a party, celebration or even just a barbeque?”

A great place for having a cold drink as you light a campfire, tucked away in the bush while watching the sunset and only had to drive a few miles from Bamburi to enjoy this!

Nguuni reserve has giraffes, ostriches, waterbucks and different species of birds to watch while you enjoy your BBQ.

For a very affordable amount, you can book a fixed table, bring your own food and drinks as they provide the fire and grill for you while you sit back and enjoy the sunset.

Nguuni Nature Sanctuary
Who would have thought you could sit having a drink by a camp fire and feel like you were in the bush just a mile or so from Bamburi township and around 3kilometers from Bamburi Cement Works. It was a first for me, but I'm sure it won't be the last.

Up on the Nguu Tatu Hills (3 hills), you are in completely natural surroundings, and can see virtually nothing but unspoilt bush around you, (except in one direction where Bamburi Township is below you and quite close by).

The reserve itself has giraffes, elands, oryx, waterbucks, ostriches and bird watching bandas.

You can book one of the big fixed tables for 2,000 shillings, then its 300 shillings per person, bring your own food, and drink, they provide the fire and the big charcoal grill, and a guy to man it.</p>

        <p>The first meeting for the proposal to build the temple was called on Wednesday 12th May 1957 at Karsanbhai Premji Bhudia’s residence. After a series of meetings the decisive meeting was held on 6th June 1957 with an attendance of approximately 40 to 50 Satsangis. It was anomalously decided that the temple be built with reference to Shree Cutch Satsang Swaminarayan Temple’s constitution under the Flagship of Shree Swaminarayan Temple Bhuj - Kutch (Nar-Narayan Dev). A general meeting in regards to the above was called on 7th July 1957 at the Shree Cutchhi Leva Patel Samaj. The project was anonymously agreed by all and by the Lord’s grace funds started flowing in from the first day. A record of KSh. 178,478.25 was collected on that very day and rising to KSh. 201,052.00 by the end of the week. 

            On 22nd July 1957 a general meeting was called to decide as where the Temple should be located. Shree Karsanbhai Premji announced that Shree Visrambhai Samji of Dahinsra had a plot valued at 138,000.00 on Station Road opposite The Patel Samaj. The proposal was hailed with the name of the Lord even before Karsanbhai had finished his word. 

            On 18th August 1957, the Aarshivad Patra (Blessings) from Bhuj was read out in the evening sabha. Shree Muljibhai Devraj of Surajpur did the ground-breaking ceremony with a kind donation of KSh. 5,001. 

            The Murtis’ of Shree Sahajanand Swami, Harikrishna Radhakrishna and NarNarayan Dev were prepared in Bhuj. The Murtis’ arrived at Mombasa port on 19th November 1959. The Murtis’ were installed on 1st February 1960 after a Bhagvad Parayan, Vishnu Yag done by Shuklaji Jayashankar. The Provincial commissioner did the official opening of the temple building on 30th January 1960. Shree Laxmidas Madwani of Kenya sugarcanes did the flag hosting ceremony on 1st February 1960.</p>

        <p>Mamba Village, East Africa's largest crocodile farm, is a "must see" during your exploratory beach vacation in Mombasa if you have not seen any crocodiles on safari. Each section of the estate offers a unique experience, and the most popular is the crocodile farm where these aquatic reptiles are displayed.

            Your tour of the farm begins with a video presentation that introduces you to many reptile species and the valuable roles they play in the ecosystems of the world and the fascinating facts, such as the longevity of the species on earth, bite force and average life span, will give you a greater appreciation for these prehistoric animals.

            While touring the crocodile farm, your guide will enlighten you about the crocodile life cycle and behavior while you view live crocodiles of every size, from hatchlings to fully-grown adults. Some crocodile displays are labeled with a description of age, length and weight, and one of the most predictable events at the farm is the daily crocodile feeding where the giants fight for fresh meat.

            While the crocodile farm is the most popular area of the village, AfricanMecca guests may also enjoy horseback riding on its small estate and beginners can even take lessons, or you may prefer the more outlandish camel riding. Should you have time, take a leisurely walk through the botanical gardens before enjoying a meal at the village restaurant that features a range of game meats, such as crocodile, zebra, ostrich and many other choices.

        <h1>Wild Waters</h1>
        <img id="img1" src="https://www.wildwaterskenya.com/img/bannerbg0.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>Wild Waters Mombasa is a water park in Nyali, Mombasa. That introduction, however, does not do Kenya’s largest water park justice. The water park is a family-themed, fun-filled, adrenalin rush, all-you-can-do-with-water kind of place. While everyone else is heading down to the beach to have a one-foot wave meekly splash against their feet, the real water action is taking place at Wild Waters Mombasa.

            This one of a kind water park in Kenya is located in Nyali along Links Road. It is adjacent to Mamba Village across from Nyali Golf Club. You can’t miss it. Except maybe on Mondays when it is usually closed. Maybe then you can actually enjoy a relaxing day in any one of Mombasa’s best beach resorts.

            Let’s Slide Into It
            Wild Waters Mombasa’s highlight feature is its slides. The slides come in various styles all guaranteed to have your heart racing as you speed down faster than the legal speed limit in Kenya – a bit of an exaggeration there – all to end up in a big splash down at the pool.
            Multine and Harakiri
            For those of you who may know a thing or two about Japanese Samurai culture, Harakiri was the act by a Samurai of committing suicide by disembowelment rather than surrender or be caught by the enemy. It was considered a dignified way to die rather than suffer the humiliation of being caught by the enemy. Now, why the good people at Wild Waters Mombasa decided to name one of their slides that is anyone’s guess. However, Multine and Harakiri are four slides joined next to each other and are quite popular with families or groups. Usually, the point is four individuals to take their marks at the top of the slide, sliding mats in hand, and race down the wet slides and skim across the water surface on the pool below. It’s just a lot of fun.

            Spirals
            Spirals are slides made like tubes that spiral all the way down to the pool below. Once you enter the tube at the top, you are engulfed in total darkness as you speedily spiral down the slide which opens up into the pool below. As you guessed it, this only ends one way. A big splash into the pool. Basically, slide, splash, repeat!

            Flume Bowl
            The flume bowl is a slide that ends in a bowl-like structure than one spins around in until being dropped in the middle down to the swimming pool. You’d have to experience it to really get its thrill. Worth noting is that this slide is strictly for adults only who are good swimmers as the pool below is five feet deep.

            The Water Play Station
            This is an area of Wild Waters Mombasa particularly popular with kids. Water Play Station has jets of water spraying from all directions. Children can climb the structure in the spraying water and splash around in the shallow pool. One amazing feature of the Water Play Station is an enormous bucket that fills up with water and automatically tilts over to pour the water on all and sundry in the Water Play Station.

            Lazy River
            The Lazy River is quite literally for lazying around. It is a 270-meter river-like channel of water that surrounds the entire water park. One can lay atop a tube and just drift away in the river taking in the sunshine and observing everything going on around you.

            The Rain Dance Area



            Dancing in the rain is a long-standing theme in Romantic films and whatnot. If, for some reason, this is an item on your bucket list, well, best to do it at Wild Waters Mombasa. The Rain Dance Area is an area set aside for dancing with music playing and artificial rain falling on the ‘dance floor’.

            Kids Pool
            5 pools, smaller slides, and a castle comprise the kids’ pool area. Kids can have their own fun in a safe area with reasonable depths of water.</p>
     
        <h1>Mama Ngina Waterfront</h1>
        <img id="img2" src="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mama-Ngina-waterfront-park-696x391.jpeg?ezimgfmt=ngcb11/notWebP" alt=""/>
        <p>Kenya officially opened Mama Ngina Waterfront Park that was redeveloped at US $4.6m. The seaside public park was reopened to the public on 20th October 2019 for the Mashujaa Day fete.

            The 26-acre park that overlooks the Kilindini Channel in Mombasa County has been transformed into an integrated urban tourist attraction site. The refurbishment included landscaping and paving the waterfront with concrete blocks, construction of an amphitheatre, the Kilindini Cultural Centre, ablution blocks and two main gates.

            The park is the first public landscaped waterfront in the country. The government however has has plans to redevelop the Jomo Kenyatta public beach in northern mainland of Mombasa, the Malindi waterfront, and others in Naivasha and Kisumu on lakes Naivasha and Victoria respectively.

            New features
            Mama Ngina park has always been a place for leisure resting, walking, jogging and riding. It is famous for its fried cassava and all manner of fried potatoes and pastries. The project was designed to support a 24-hour economy and its layout includes a new jetty for water taxis.

            The waterfront now features a palm tree-lined walkway from the Likoni Ferry Crossing to its south through to the Mombasa Golf Club to the north. These two points are the entry and exit points both ways, and are now marked by huge monumental gates.

            The waterfront park also has a sun-drenched 2.1km long promenade and a space for food vendors. The sitting area now a properly built amphitheatre, has more greenery with newly planted palm trees and grass where visitors can while away time.


            The walkway has rail guards separating it from the cliff-face, just above the pounding waves crashing onto the rocks below making it a safe, family-friendly place. For years, this park has housed the famous Florida Nightclub & Casino and Galaxy Chinese Restaurant on the northern edge. These have been incorporated into the cultural vista of the new look park.

            The amphitheatre’s design was derailed from the ancient Rome. It has a seating capacity of 3,000 people who will comfortably enjoy live cultural events and performances. The original parking squares have been retained next to the walkway to ensure orderliness. Being open 24-hours a day, the park is well lit with strategically placed security lighting, a police post and public toilets.

            The redevelopment was undertaken by a local company, Suhufi Agencies. According to President Uhuru Kenyatta, the park is expected to restore the glory of Mombasa as a top tourist destination in the region.</p>
        
        <h1>Gedi Ruins</h1>
        <img id="img1" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Great_Mosque_of_Gede.jpg/1280px-Great_Mosque_of_Gede.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>Gedi lies on the coastal region of Kenya, 94 km north of Mombasa town, another historic town. Gedi was a small town built entirely from rocks and stones, which was inhabited by Swahili people of East Africa. This historic town date back from the 15th century, and through careful preservation most of the original foundations can still be seen today. In 1927, the Gedi historic town, which occupy an area of 44 hectares of land, were declared a historic monument and much excavation and preservation work carried out such that large areas of this ancient town are now revealed, including the pillar tombs, the palace and a great mosque.

            The historic town of Gedi occupied a very large area and had two walls around it. The inner wall was where the rich lived. The outer wall enclosed 18 hectares which also included farm and plantation land with quite a number of mud and wattle houses for the middle class. Outside the walls is where the peasants lived.

            There is a dated coral tomb with beautiful Arabic script engraved with the date 1399. From the dated tomb, one can see the Great Mosque. A spectacular 50m deep well, known as the "Well of the Great Mosque" which must have been used for ablutions is still discernible. On the other side of the mosque stands the Octagonal pillar tomb of the Imam or priest. Further into the forest, one can see the 15th century palace where the king held court and addressed women with marital problems. Chambers which had no windows or doors are believed to have been used by the noblemen to store their gold and jewels. The only way to gain entrance was through a secret door from the roof.

            Over the historic town, the shallow coral rag soil has grown a lowland semi-deciduous forest, maintained by a rainfall of around 1,100 mm/year. The 44 hectares site, surrounded by farmland, is entirely fenced, and contains around 35 hectares of coastal forest, traversed by narrow paths that wind between the excavated buildings. At least 50 indigenous tree species occur, including Gyrocarpus americanus and Sterculia appendiculata.

            It is not quite clear why the town was eventually deserted. Several theories have been put across:

            1. One of the theories is that it was overcome by an army from Mombasa on its way to attack Malindi around 1530 AD.

            2. Another theory suggests that the Galla people who were raiding southwards around 1600 AD made life unbearable.

            3. It is also theorized that lack of water (drying of the wells) except the one which was outside the walls contributed to its abandonment.

            Whatever theory is true, one thing is clear, the nobles did not flee; they had time to empty their gold and precious stones in their secret vaults since none of this type of wealth has ever been found.

            Justification of Outstanding Universal Value
            (ii), (iv): The historic town presents us with evidence of the development of an architectural complex consisting of mosques, palaces, and living quarters that were protected with two stone walls around it making it a unique landscape at this period in history.

            (iii): The historic town is an outstanding testimony to the social and economic structure of the inhabitants of Gedi around the 13th century AD. Gedi was one of the most prosperous Swahili city states before its decline in the 18th Century.

            Statements of authenticity and/or integrity
            Gedi historic town is a gazetted National Monument since 1927; it is managed by the National Museums of Kenya. This was the first site to be excavated in East Africa and has remained the most intact of the preserved Swahili historic towns. It has been published extensively compared to other sites.

            Comparison with other similar properties
            The history of the rise and fall of Gedi is intricately linked to what was happening to the other Swahili states along the eastern coast of Africa such as Kilwa. While they share this history, its architectural designs are equivalent to those of the historic cities of Kilwa Kisiwani and Songo Mnara in Tanzania.</p>
        
        <h1>Bombolulu Workshops and Cultural Centre</h1>
        <img id="img2" src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/KEN/kenya-mombasa-bombolulu-workshops-and-cultural-centre.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>Are you looking for things to buy in Mombasa? At Bombolulu Workshops you can shop and help disabled Kenyans at the same time.

        This non-profit organization is a project of the Association for the Physically Disabled in Kenya, with four sheltered workshops, a cultural center, and restaurant.

        At the cultural center, you can enjoy tribal dance performances and explore traditional homesteads found throughout Kenya.

        If shopping is high on your agenda, you can visit the workshops and purchase handcrafted souvenirs, which include jewelry, textiles, wood carving, and leather crafts. Proceeds help sustain the center's work.

        After touring the grounds, stop by the restaurant to sample Kenyan-inspired cuisine.

        Address: Workshop Road, Bombolulu.
        Bombolulu Workshops and Cultural Centre is a programme of The Association for the Physically Disabled of Kenya.

        I took a group of British students to this charity run establishment and found it a very worthwhile experience. We were greeted by clapping and dancing ‘tribes’ who encourage you to do the same as you enter.

        We had a fabulous local lunch in the large thatched hut, local tea then more local dancing.

        We then had a rather sobering (but interesting) tour of the workshops where people with disabilities were busy making their produce which you could later buy in the large shop. Employing the disabled and providing housing is essential here as the disabled are considered cursed and are often shunned or hidden away by their families, and, of course, treatment is not widely available. I did find the nursery rather upsetting.

        Then you can wander and experience the local ways of life which are recreated and explained.

        All students (and teachers alike) found it a very interesting visit; it certainly provided an insight into the local life culture of disadvantaged Kenyans.

        <h1>Likoni Floating Bridge</h1>
        <img id="img1" src="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/files/styles/article_style/public/images/media/An%20artists%20impression%20of%20a%20floating%20bridge..jpg?itok=OGYe5gNX" alt="" />
        <p>Kenya has recently launched a 1.2-kilometer floating bridge across the Likoni Channel, which serves as a gateway for Mombasa Port. Ferries are currently used to transport people and vehicles across the channel, but due to increased demand as the population of the city grows, the viability of the ferry service has become limited.

        It is estimated that about 300,000 pedestrians and 6,000 vehicles cross the channel daily, causing immense congestion during peak demand hours.

        The new floating pedestrian bridge will help alleviate this pressure, and it is expected to be operational beginning on January 1. The $17 million bridge was built by China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), and it is of Bailey type, made of lattice steel designed from prefabricated parts. It has a six meter wide bridge deck and 715 meter long floating section. In the middle, it has a 150 meter swing opening to allow the passage of ships calling at Mombasa Port to transit through the channel.

        The bridge will be operated by Kenya Ports Authority, whose tag boats will be deployed to open and close the movable part one hour before a ship passes. This will also provide sufficient time for withdrawing undersea gravity anchors.

        Although the bridge can last for over 50 years, it will be used temporarily as a way to address social distancing at the channel due to passengers’ overcrowding. It will be dismantled once the permanent Mombasa Gate Bridge project is completed, which is currently at design stage and estimated to cost $1.8 billion.
