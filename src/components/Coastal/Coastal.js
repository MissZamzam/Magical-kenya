                          <h4>Historicla Landmarks</h4>
        <p>The ruined city of Gedi is one of Kenyaâ€™s greatest mysteries. Founded in the early 13th century deep into the thick forests just outside Watamu, Gede was later completely abandoned, and no one really knows why. A bit like a mini Angkor Wat, the ruins at Gede are fascinating, with numerous coral-brick houses, a palace, and even a mosque to visit.

        <p>Palm-lined shores, crystal-clear waters, coral reefs, and a profusion of water sports, resorts, and entertainment venues provide plenty of tourist action. The resorts are also closer to the airport and Mombasa City.</p>
