      <p className="text-center">

        arguably the best safari destinations and the most perfect tropical
        beaches. The accommodation - whether bush or beach - ranges from rustic
        and adventurous to family-friendly, romantic honeymoon hideaways to
        lavish, exclusive luxury. Whether you want to simply relax after a
        safari or explore and experience the coastal attractions and water
        activities, Coastal Kenya has a place just for you.

                <h4>Water Sports</h4>
                <p>
                  The harbor and beach provide ideal conditions for diving,
                  snorkeling, and fishing enthusiasts; while the cities are home
                  to wildlife parks, beaches, and an abundance of restaurants
                  and bars to enjoy after your day out on the water. The beauty
                  of Mombasa has drawn tourists from all over Africa as well as
                  international visitors looking to explore this coastal city in
                  Kenya.

                <h4>Historical Sites</h4>
                <p>
                  The ruined city of Gedi is one of Kenyaâ€™s greatest mysteries.
                  Founded in the early 13th century deep into the thick forests
                  just outside Watamu, Gede was later completely abandoned, and
                  no one really knows why. A bit like a mini Angkor Wat, the
                  ruins at Gede are fascinating, with numerous coral-brick
                  houses, a palace, and even a mosque to visit.

                <h4>Local Food</h4>
                <p>
                  Exploring the food of the Kenyan coast is a lesson in history.
                  The dishes are a mix of the many cultures of the region, from
                  the Bantu peoples to Islamic, Indian, and European influences.
                  To eat along the coast of Kenya is to learn its rich Swahili
                  past.

                <h4>Coast Beaches</h4>
                <p>
                  Palm-lined shores, crystal-clear waters, coral reefs, and a
                  profusion of water sports, resorts, and entertainment venues
                  provide plenty of tourist action. The resorts are also closer
                  to the airport and Mombasa City.
